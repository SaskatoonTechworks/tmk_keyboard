Planck keyboard firmware
======================
DIY/Assembled compact ortholinear keyboard by
[Ortholinear Keyboards](http://ortholinearkeyboards.com).

## Notable TMK forks (which some of the keymap files are from)
- [Shane's Fork](https://github.com/shanecelis/tmk_keyboard/tree/master/keyboard/planck)
- [Pierre's Fork](https://github.com/pcarrier/tmk_keyboard/blob/pcarrier/planck/keyboard/gh60/keymap_planck.c)

## Build

Follow [this guide](http://deskthority.net/workshop-f7/how-to-build-your-very-own-keyboard-firmware-t7177.html)
to setup your development environment before anything else.

Download the whole firmware
[here](https://github.com/jackhumbert/tmk_keyboard/archive/master.zip)
and navigate to the keyboard/planck folder. Once your dev env is setup,
you'll be able to type "make" to generate your .hex that you can load
with the Teensy app onto your Planck (once you've hit reset/shorted
GND & RST).

Move to this directory then just run `make` like:

    $ make


## Keymap
Several version of keymap are available in advance but you are
recommended to define your favorite layout yourself. To define your own
keymap create file named `keymap_<name>.c` and see keymap document(you
can find in top README.md) and existent keymap files.

To build firmware binary hex file with a certain keymap just do `make`
with `KEYMAP` option like:

    $ make KEYMAP=[<name>]
