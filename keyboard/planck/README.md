Planck keyboard firmware
======================
DIY/Assembled compact ortholinear keyboard by [Ortholinear Keyboards](http://ortholinearkeyboards.com).

## Notable TMK forks (which some of the keymap files are from)
- [Shane's Fork](https://github.com/shanecelis/tmk_keyboard/tree/master/keyboard/planck)
- [Pierre's Fork](https://github.com/pcarrier/tmk_keyboard/blob/pcarrier/planck/keyboard/gh60/keymap_planck.c)
- [Nathan's Fork](https://github.com/nathanrosspowell/tmk_keyboard/tree/planck-jack/keyboard/planck)
- [Matthew's Fork](https://github.com/pepers/tmk_keyboard/tree/master/keyboard/planck_grid)

## Build
Move to this directory then just run `make` like:

    $ make

Use `make -f Makefile.pjrc` if you want to use PJRC stack but I find no reason to do so now.


## Keymap
Several version of keymap are available in advance but you are recommended to define your favorite layout yourself. To define your own keymap create file named `keymap_<name>.c` and see keymap document(you can find in top README.md) and existent keymap files.

To build firmware binary hex file with a certain keymap just do `make` with `KEYMAP` option like:

    $ make KEYMAP=[<name>]
